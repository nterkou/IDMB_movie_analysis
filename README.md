🎬 IMDb Movies Analysis Project (PowerBI Dashboard)
In this project me and my team analyzed a dataset of 999 movies sourced from Kaggle and created a PowerBI dashboard as part of the Big Blue Data Academy Data Science Bootcamp. 

🎯 Objective: Creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze IMDb movie performance based on genres, directors, release years, gross, age ratings as well as comparing audience ratings with critics’ scores.
